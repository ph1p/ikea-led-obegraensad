# Control the board

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf91be1-2c95-4adc-b178-05b0781683cc

You can control the lamp with a supplied web GUI.
You can get the IP via serial output or you can search it in your router settings.

# How to

First of all. This software was written for the ESP32 Dev Board, but it should work with any other Arduino board as well. You just need to remove the WiFi, OTA and web server related code.

The ESP32 I used:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15351728/200148521-86d0f9e6-2c41-4707-b2d9-8aa24a0e440e.jpg" width="60%" />

Verified to work with TTGO LoRa32 V2.1 (T3_V1.6.1).
Note: On esp8266 per pixel brightness only works when storage and global brightness (analogWrite) are disabled.

## Open the lamp

I'm sorry to say this, but you'll have to pry open the back of your Lamp, as IKEA didn't install regular screws here. I lifted the back with a screwdriver between the screws and pried it open with a second object, but you can also drill out the rivets to avoid breaking the backpanel.

## The panels

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15351728/200183585-39c1668d-665b-4c12-bcbb-387aec1d3874.JPG" width="60%" />

After you open the back, you will see 4 identical plates. These are each equipped with 64 Leds in 4 fields. We are only interested in the lowest one. Here you will find 6 connectors at the bottom edge, to which we connect our board.
Above is a microcontroller. You have to remove it, because it contains the standard programs.

### ESP32 Setup with VS Code and PlatformIO

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Install **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.
   - Install the **PlatformIO IDE** extension from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

2. **Clone the Project**

   - Download the project from GitHub and open it in VS Code. PlatformIO will automatically load dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ph1p/ikea-led-obegraensad.git
cd ikea-led-obegraensad
code .
```

3. **Connect ESP32**

   - Connect your ESP32 via USB.
   - Check the COM port in the **PlatformIO Devices** tab.

4. **Prepare the Project**

   - Perform a `PlatformIO: Clean` (Recycle bin icon at the bottom right).
   - Add a `secrets.h` file to the `include` directory. Modify passwords and save the file. Go in the next section for WiFi instructions.

```cpp
#pragma once

#define WIFI_HOSTNAME ""

#ifdef ESP8266
#define WIFI_SSID ""
#define WIFI_PASSWORD ""
#endif

#define OTA_USERNAME ""
#define OTA_PASSWORD ""
```

- Set variables inside `include/constants.h`.

5. **Build the Project**

   - Click the `PlatformIO Build` icon (bottom right corner).
   - Check the log for missing libraries.
     - Use the **Libraries** icon in PlatformIO to install required libraries.
   - Repeat `Clean` and `Build` until the build succeeds.

6. **Upload to ESP32**
   - Click `PlatformIO Upload` (bottom right) to upload the firmware to the ESP32.

### Configuring WiFi with WiFi manager

_Note:_ The WiFi manager only works on ESP32. For ESP8266, `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` need to be provided in `secrets.h`.

This project uses [tzapu's WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager). After booting up, the device will try
to connect to known access points. If no known access point is available, the device will create a network called
`Ikea Display Setup WiFi`. Connect to this network on any device. A captive portal will pop up and will take you
through the configuration process. After a successful connection, the device will reboot and is ready to go.

The name of the created network can be changed by modifying `WIFI_MANAGER_SSID` in `include/constants.h`.

### PINS

Connect them like this and remember to set them in `include/constants.h` according to your board.

### Alternate Button Wiring

Thanks to [RBEGamer](https://github.com/RBEGamer) who is showing in this [issue](https://github.com/ph1p/ikea-led-obegraensad/issues/79) how to use the original button wiring. With this solution you won't need the "BUTTON one end" and "BUTTON other end" soldering from the table above.

Example configuration for an automation setting the brightness to low when the sun sets.

- Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  rest_command:
    obegraensad_brightness_high:
      url: "http://192.168.178.68/api/brightness/"
      method: PATCH
      content_type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
      payload: "value=100"
    obegraensad_brightness_low:
      url: "http://192.168.178.68/api/brightness/"
      method: PATCH
      content_type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
      payload: "value=1"
  ```

- Go to *Settings* --> *Automations* and create a new automation.
- Select *Edit in YAML* and add the following content:
  ```yaml
  alias: Obegraensad low bightness
  description: ""
  triggers:
    - trigger: sun
      event: sunset
      offset: 0
  conditions: []
  actions:
    - action: rest_command.obegraensad_brightness_low
      data: {}
  mode: single
  ```
- To set the brightness back to bright, create e.g. another automation or a condition and call `rest_command.obegraensad_brightness_high`

# Development

- `src` contains the arduino code.

  - Run it with platform io
  - You can uncomment the OTA lines in `platformio.ini` if you want. Replace the IP with your device IP.

- `frontend` contains the web code.

  - First run `pnpm install`
  - Set your device IP inside the `.env` file
  - Start the server with `pnpm dev`
  - Build it with `pnpm build`. This command creates the `webgui.cpp` for you.

- Build frontend using `Docker`
  - From the root of the repo, run `docker compose run node`

# Plugin Development

1. Start by creating a new C++ file for your plugin. For example, let's call it plugins/MyPlugin.(cpp/h).

**plugins/MyPlugin.h**

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "PluginManager.h"

class MyPlugin : public Plugin {
public:
    MyPlugin();
    ~MyPlugin() override;

    void setup() override;
    void loop() override;
    const char* getName() const override;

    void teardown() override; // optional
    void websocketHook(DynamicJsonDocument &request) override; // optional
};
```

**plugins/MyPlugin.cpp**

```cpp
#include "plugins/MyPlugin.h"

MyPlugin::MyPlugin() {
    // Constructor logic, if needed
}

void MyPlugin::setup() {
    // Setup logic for your plugin
}

void MyPlugin::loop() {
    // Loop logic for your plugin
}

const char* MyPlugin::getName() const {
    return "MyPlugin"; // name in GUI
}

void MyPlugin::teardown() {
  // code if plugin gets deactivated
}

void MyPlugin::websocketHook(DynamicJsonDocument &request) {
  // handle websocket requests
}
```

2. Add your plugin to the `main.cpp`.

```cpp
#include "plugins/MyPlugin.h"

pluginManager.addPlugin(new MyPlugin());
```

# Troubleshooting

## Flickering panel

- Check all soldering points, especially VCC
- Check if the board gets enough power
